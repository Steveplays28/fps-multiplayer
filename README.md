# Unnamed multiplayer FPS game  
Made in Godot, uses the [NExLib](https://github.com/steveplays28/nexlib) library for multiplayer networking.

Still very much work in progress, this readme will be updated with images, extra info, and more once it's ready for that.  
This is going to be a multiplayer first person shooter (fps), with the movement system most likely being a blend between Rainbow Six Siege's slower paced movement and Titanfall 2's fast paced movement.

For now, feel free to have a look at the code!
